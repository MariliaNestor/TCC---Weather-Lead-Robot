This is an algorithm planned and written by me when I was a a Journalism student. It is a simple program for automation of weather forecasting in Python 3 using web data scraping. The code was made after a semester of studies on Computing, programming languages and its applications in the field of Journalism, while the academic studies behind it, based on the Science Design methodology, seek not only a theoretical basis, but also intend to be an incentive and model for other students, teachers and professionals.
